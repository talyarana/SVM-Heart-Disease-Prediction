## 📌 Executive Summary  

This project builds and evaluates **three Support Vector Machine (SVM) models** using **Microsoft Excel Solver** to assist a medical clinic in **early detection of heart disease**.

Using real cardiology data, the models classify patients based on:
- Age  
- Resting blood pressure  
- Cholesterol  
- Maximum heart rate  

A **semi-supervised SVM (SVM3)** was selected as the optimal solution due to its **high accuracy, robustness to incomplete data, and low misclassification rate**.

---

## 🔎 Business Context  

A local GP clinic has observed a rapid increase in patients suffering from **cardiovascular problems**. Early diagnosis is critical for:
- Reducing medical risk  
- Improving patient survival  
- Optimising hospital resources  

This project answers:

> **Can we use machine learning (SVM) inside Excel to reliably predict heart disease risk?**

## 🎯 Objectives  

- Build **three SVM models** (Hard margin, Soft margin, Semi-supervised)  
- Compare performance using **Accuracy, Recall, Precision, Specificity**  
- Tune model performance using the **λ (Lambda)** penalty parameter  
- Select the **best predictive model** for real-world diagnosis

## 📂 Data  

Each patient record contains:
- Age  
- Blood Pressure  
- Cholesterol  
- Maximum Heart Rate  
- Diagnosis (Healthy or Sick)  

The dataset was split into:
- **Training data**
- **Test data**

## ⚙️ Modelling Approach  

Three models were built:

| Model | Type | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| **SVM1** | Hard margin | Requires perfect separation (often infeasible) |
| **SVM2** | Soft margin | Allows limited misclassification using λ |
| **SVM3** | Semi-supervised | Uses labelled & unlabelled data for robustness |

Excel **Solver** was used to optimise model parameters.

## 📊 Evaluation Metrics  

| Metric | Meaning |
|-------|--------|
| Accuracy | Overall correct predictions |
| Recall | Ability to detect sick patients |
| Precision | Correctness of healthy predictions |
| Specificity | Rate of correct negative classifications |

## 📈 Model Comparison (Training Data)

**Table 1 – Metric Comparison**

| Metric | SVM1 | SVM2 (λ=0) | SVM3 (λ=0) |
|-------|------|-----------|-----------|
| Accuracy | Infeasible | 84% | 84% |
| Recall | Infeasible | 88% | 78% |
| Precision | Infeasible | 70% | 70% |
| Specificity | Infeasible | 93% | 93% |

SVM1 failed due to non-linear data.  
SVM2 and SVM3 performed well and were selected for deeper tuning.

## 🧠 Optimal Model (SVM3)

Using **λ = 70**, the decision parameters are:

| Variable | λ=0 | λ=70 | λ=1000 |
|--------|------|------|--------|
| Age (x1) | 0.00297 | 0.00271 | 0.00139 |
| Blood Pressure (x2) | -0.0305 | -0.0296 | 0.0093 |
| Cholesterol (x3) | 0.00130 | 0.00129 | 0.00054 |
| Max Heart Rate (x4) | -0.0389 | -0.0383 | -0.0198 |
| Intercept | 9.305 | 9.104 | 3.875 |
